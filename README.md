# Weather You Like It Or Not, Mira's weather project

Ready for a weather adventure? The site starts by showing the weather for three cities. You can scroll through the forecast for each horizontally.

Once you get to the bottom of the list, there is a button for you to add your own city! Just type in the city using the search bar, and choose the correct result.

Chose the wrong city or don't want to see the presets? No problem! Just remove them using the remove button by the city name.

Enjoy!
